<summary><h3>💡 <code>Shivansu's Coding Journey</code> 🚀</h3></summary>

#### 🌱 The Beginning  
I got hooked on code while exploring how websites come to life. That curiosity turned into a full-blown obsession—so I dove into HTML, CSS, and JS to create my first web projects.

#### 🔧 Into the Back-End  
Things got more exciting when I moved to server-side magic—PHP and Java became my go-to tools for building scalable and secure web apps.

#### 🧠 Data Dive  
To support those projects, I developed a solid understanding of DBMS concepts, ensuring clean and efficient data flow.

#### 📈 Growing Every Day  
My recent projects include real-world applications like weather apps and portfolio sites. I'm constantly pushing my limits with new tools, frameworks, and ideas!
