<details> <summary><h3>🚀 Shivansu's Coding Journey</h3></summary> My journey into the world of coding began with a deep curiosity about how the digital tools and applications we use daily are built. This curiosity quickly turned into a passion, driving me to explore the depths of programming and software development.

🌱 The Early Days
I started with the basics—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—building simple web pages and interactive elements. These foundational skills gave me a solid understanding of how the web works and sparked my interest in creating more complex, dynamic applications.

🛠️ Diving into Backend Development
As my skills grew, I gravitated towards backend development, where I found my true calling. I delved into PHP and Java, mastering the art of building scalable and secure applications. Working with frameworks like Laravel and Spring, I developed everything from small projects to large-scale systems.

📱 Expanding into Mobile Development
My curiosity didn't stop at web development; I expanded my expertise into mobile development. Learning frameworks like Flutter and React Native opened up a new world of possibilities, allowing me to create seamless, cross-platform mobile applications. Whether it’s building a feature-rich financial app or an intuitive educational tool, I strive to deliver top-notch user experiences.

🌐 Embracing DevOps
Understanding that development doesn’t stop at coding, I embraced DevOps practices to streamline and automate the deployment process. GitHub Actions, Docker, and cloud platforms like AWS and Azure became integral tools in my workflow, enabling me to deliver applications efficiently and reliably.

🌟 Current Focus
Today, I’m focused on pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with technology. My projects, like a comprehensive weather app and a user-friendly EMIS system for educational management, reflect my commitment to creating solutions that address real-world challenges.

🚀 Looking Forward
As I continue to evolve as a developer, I’m excited to explore new technologies and contribute to innovative projects. I believe in the power of collaboration and am always open to working with like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology and innovation.
